# Big Data Analytics Project — DSAA 2024/2025
## Forecasting Apple's Stock Using Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning

Welcome to our **Big Data Analytics (BDA)** project for the **NOVA IMS Master in Data Science & Advanced Analytics**!  
This repository contains the code, notebooks, and resources used to process, analyze, and visualize large datasets using Apache Spark on **Databricks Community Edition**.

---

## Project Summary

The goal of this project is to empower individual investors by predicting Apple Inc.'s stock performance using Big Data tools and machine learning models. We stream and preprocess financial data, engineer predictive features, and implement LSTM and Random Forest-based strategies to simulate investment decisions.


##  Project Guidelines

As part of the course deliverables, our project must follow these requirements:

### Requirements
- **Problem Definition:** Identify a relevant Big Data problem.
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Obtain, clean, and preprocess large datasets.
- **Big Data Processing:** Use **Apache Spark Modules** (SQL, MLlib, or Streaming).
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Apply machine learning, statistics, or BI tools.
- **Results & Insights:** Present findings through report


## Deliverables

-  **Technical Report** – Detailed analysis and project explanation
- **Databricks Notebook** – All code for data processing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation
- **Portfolio Simulation Outputs** – Strategy vs. benchmark comparison
- **Random Forest Strategy** – Classification-based trading strategy
- **Model Selection Insights** – LSTM model comparison and rationale
